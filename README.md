ResRev 

Introduction

ResRev app is a simple ruby application that can help users to add and review restaurants.

The app allows users to sign up, log in directly or with third party login(google & github) and log out; create, edit and delete their own added restaurants & reviews and see all of the other restaurants created by other users.

This app is developed as a portfolio project for Flatiron School's Online part time Software Engineering Program.

The template for the app was mainly created using rails resource generator which created most of the file directory when comencing the project.
